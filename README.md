# brew.py

A lightweight replacement for Homebrew

see [usage](#usage) below.


## Install

Copy `brew.py` to anywhere, where it can be found by your shell.
Or add a new path to your `$PATH`.

In your shell config (e.g., `.zprofile`) add

```sh
export BREW_PY_CELLAR=$HOME/any/path/you/like
```


## FAQ

### Why this project?

Well, I hate dependencies.
For years, I have been avoiding Homebrew because of the large codebase and because Homebrew installs a lot of stuff in a lot of different places.
And I did not want to audit every single installation.

Most of the time, I just need a single binary and thus fallback to downloading that binary manually.
That's how this script started â€“ as a way to download a single binary.
And then it escalated quickly.
Now I am trying to copy some of the functionality of brew itself and the, once simple script, is growing into a full-fledged Homebrew-alternative suite.

I don't know if anybody can make use of this, but here you go.


### What is the scope?

I don't know yet.
Maybe I will add more features, and copy more of the original brew CLI.
But most importantly, it should be simple and dependency free.

brew.py focuses on:
- downloading pre-built binaries (bottles) from Brew.sh or GitHub registry
- re-link dynamic libraries (.dylib) to use relative paths
- provide a structure for other brew packages to link to shared libs

What brew.py does **NOT** do:
- build from source code
- search or browse packages (use Brew.sh for that)
- formula analysis & dependency checks (use Brew.sh to check if a package is suitable for your machine)
- cask management (beyond mere download)
